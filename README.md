# Nintendo Switch Theme for EmulationStation on 480x320 displays
I've been working on some modifications to an older fork of this theme, hoping to more closely match the look of the Switch system software. Changes include:
- Updated fonts to match system software
- Updated colors to match system software
- Sizing and spacing adjustments to fit RG351 screen sizes
- Updated colors, sizes, and spacing for EmulationStation menu
- Various aesthetic adjustments
